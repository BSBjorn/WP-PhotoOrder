# WP-PhotoOrder
A script/plugin for wordpress to allow users to select photos from a post. When the visitor has selected the photos the would like to order the photographer recieves an e-mail with the photo (names?).

This will be my first github project, so bear with me. I intent to use the php mail() function inside the loop, the photos are uploaded and stored in a custom field to a post. 

Each photo is a variable and the idea is to use  for each to list the photos. 

I believe a simple jQuery onClick.ToggleClass would let the users se wich photos they have selected.
